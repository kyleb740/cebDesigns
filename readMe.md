This website was designed for my Code Louisville project.  The website is for my father who is a woodworker and does residential remodeling.  

To access the project download the repository files and open index.html in your chosen browser.

The Custom CSS classes are:
  1. .action in my stylesheet.css (for this class I added a linear gradient background for my call to action area)

  2. .explain in my portstyle.css (this class centered the text, added font weight to make the text bolder, added padding and margin to improve spacing)

  3. .form_button in my contactstyle.css (this class styled the submit button for my contact form.  It changed the background color, made the text bold, and added padding and margin to improve the spacing)

The JavaScript functions I created are:
  1. On my contact form I created a function for a modal to open when the submit button is clicked.  I also created a function to remove the modal when the (x) is clicked or when the user clicks outside of the screen.
